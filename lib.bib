abstract="In 1992, MPEG-1 was created as the first standard for encoding moving pictures accompanied by sound. The aim was to achieve a picture quality close to that of VHS at CD data rates (< 1.5 Mbit/s). MPEG-1 was provided only for applications on storage media (CD, hard disk) and not for transmission (broadcasting) and its data structures correspond to this objective. The audio and video coding of MPEG-1 is quite close to that of MPEG-2 and all the fundamental algorithms and methods are already in place. There are both I, P and B frames, i.e. forward and backward prediction, and naturally there are the DCT-based irrelevance reduction methods already found in JPEG. The picture resolution, however, is limited to about half the VGA resolution (352 {\texttimes} 288). Neither is there any necessity for field encoding (interlaced scanning method). In MPEG-1, there is only the so-called Program Stream (PS) which is composed of multiplexed packetized elementary stream (PES) packets of audio and video. The variable-length (64 kbytes max) audio and video PES packets are simply assembled interleaved in accordance with the present data rate to form a data stream. This data stream is not processed any further since it is only intended to be stored on storage media and not used for transmission. A certain number of audio and video PES packets are combined to form a so-called pack which consists of a header and the payload just like the PES packets themselves. A pack is often based on the size of a physical data sector of the storage medium.",

abstract = {We describe an approach to object and scene retrievalwhich searches for and localizes all the occurrences of auser outlined object in a video. The object is represented bya set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognitioncan proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint,illumination and partial occlusion. The temporalcontinuity of the video within a shot is used to track theregions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce theeffects of noise in the descriptors.The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementationwhere matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vectorquantization), and inverted file systems and documentrankings are used. The result is that retrieval is immediate,returning a ranked list of key frames/shots in the manner ofGoogle.The method is illustrated for matching on two full lengthfeature films.},
